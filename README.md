## What you'll find in this branch?
This is a boilerplate with skeleton routes and the needed images.
There is basic configuration for react, react-routes, express, react-redux, sass-loader, jest and other libs.

Feel free to use the current structure or change it as you wish. 

Once you fork this branch and git clone it, all you need to do is run:

```sh
npm start -s
```

This will install node_modules the first time, and then it will just start the server.

This will open 
```
http://localhost:3000/ 
```
Which will load the home page of the skeleton React app.

There's also an express route that has dummy data that you can use to fetch transactions for the Statement page:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/transactions
```
